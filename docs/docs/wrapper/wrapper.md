# Wrapper

MCDash Wrapper wraps the existing MCDash plugin and adds additional features to it.

You are now able to create servers within 30 seconds, and manage them with ease.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from Pterodactyl's Daemon and Panel. I wanted to create a similar system for
Minecraft servers, but with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Features

- Automatically manages Java versions and server files
- Support for Spigot, Paper, and Purpur
- Easy to use web interface

## Installation

If you are running MCDash on a Linux server, you can use the following script to install the wrapper:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install-mcdash.gnmyt.dev/ | bash
```

If you are running MCDash on a Windows server, you can download the latest version from GitHub and run it.

## Setup

If the installation was successful, you can now access the wrapper by visiting the following URL:
`http://<your-ip>:7865/`.
If you are running the wrapper on your local machine, you can access it by visiting `http://localhost:7865/`.

You will be prompted to create an account and log in. Once you have done that, you can start creating servers.
